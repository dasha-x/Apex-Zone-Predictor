## Project Description

Apex Zone Predictor is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the center coordinate of the fourth ring in the popular battle royale game, Apex Legends. This project stems from the critical need for professional players to strategically position themselves in the game, which offers a significant competitive edge in pro matches.

## Details

The dataset was collected specifically for this project, by taking screenshots of each ring (from ring 1 to ring 4) during gameplay on the World's Edge map. The coordinates of the center of each ring were then extracted using computer vision techniques to automate the process.

The performance of the predictor has been tested using three distinct models: linear regression, support vector regression, and recurrent neural networks.

This project was created in the scope of Concordia's Machine Learning course where students were free to pick a topic and apply in-class material to solve their chosen problem.
